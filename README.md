This is a Volleyball statiscs gathering project.

It is going to be based on a simple web runner connected to a database 
which will automatically go showing statistics of matches and players.

Structure aims to be working at differen user levels to be able to run all 
needed services.

Main ideal situation would be having different pages that analyze and run 
the data of the different players.

WIP!
